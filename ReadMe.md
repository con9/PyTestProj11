Code to find the best(longest and steepest) path down the mountain.

Reads input from file inputFile1.txt. File is parsed in InputGen.java

inputarr [0] holds the size of the input array.
 
Test inputs can also be provided in Main.java. In that case, line "inputarr = InputGen.parseFile();" should be commented out.
